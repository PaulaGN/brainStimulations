Train your Brain: Understand and increase the effect of different brain stimulations

In this project I use the data collected from the SHARP research project which aims to understand and increase the effect of different brain simulations and cognitive training on cognitive ability. 

This study records brain activity with EEG  from different participants while they are doing different computerized cognitive tasks, during which electrical brain stimulation (less than 2 mA) may applied to their scalp. During each recording the study also measures the participant performance of the cognitive task in terms of ability. 

In this study 3 different brain simulations are considered and each participant is applied to one particular brain stimulation. Previous to the cognitive tasks I also record resting EEG data during three minutes. For each brain stimulation from different subjects I analyze the rest-EEG in relation to their change in performance on different cognitive tasks. I use this to develop a model that can be used to predict which stimulation intervention should be used for an individual based on resting EEG.  

This manuscript is structured based on the Cross-industry standard process for data mining, commonly known by its acronym CRISP-DM, which is a data mining process model that describes commonly used approaches that data mining experts use to tackle problems. The  CRISP-DM includes the 5 different phases: (1) business understanding, (2) data collection, (3) data Preparation, (4) modeling, (5) evaluation and (6) model improvement.
